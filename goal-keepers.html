            <h3 class="list">This lesson plan aims to instil in students the belief
              that everyone has the potential to be a Goalkeeper
              and to take action for the Sustainable Development
              Goals (SDGs). By understanding everyone needs
              to be involved in the achievement of the SDGs,
              students will identify and appreciate the different
              skills of all individuals, as well as themselves. This
              lesson plan links to the key criteria of the 2018 OECD
              Pisa Assessment framework: Global Competence.
              Described as “the capacity to examine local, global
              and intercultural issues, to understand and appreciate
              the perspectives and world views of others, to engage
              in open, appropriate and effective interactions with
              people from different cultures, and to act for collective
              well-being and sustainable development.”<br><br>

            This lesson involves students reﬂecting on their own skills, personality and knowledge by creating a Goalkeeper portrait.
Some students may not feel comfortable with having their photograph taken and therefore can be asked to create a
Goalkeeper portrait of another student or famous Goalkeeper for the SDGs. You might also see the SDGs referred to as
The Global Goals. These are the same thing, use the terminology you prefer.<br>
            This lesson also involves uploading photos of students to the internet. Ensure this is in alignment with<br>
            your school privacy and safeguarding policy and read the Terms and Conditions of the Goalkeeper<br>

              They are ordinary people that care about making their schools, homes, communities and countries better for everyone<br>

                    Discuss this quotation as a class - <i>do students agree?</i> Explain that everyone has different skills and knowledge to<br>
                    achieve the Goals. It is how students use these to achieve the SDGs that is important. As a Goalkeeper decides to<br>

                    determined that the Goals will be achieved!<br><br>
                    Show the ‘Making Connections Between the SDGs’ activity sheet (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 5</span>). This activity is to help students<br>
                    identify the type of skills that might be needed to achieve each of the Goals. Display the 15 green words suggested in<br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 6</span> (you may wish to edit this list for your school setting). Pick one word to get started e.g creative. Write this<br>
                    in the frst red rectangle in the middle of the activity sheet.<br><br>
                    Next ask students - <i>How would the skill of creativity contribute to the Goals? Which Goal(s) would be affected the<br>
                    most?</i> Encourage students to justify their opinions and choices. Take a few suggestions from the class and connect<br>
                    creative with the chosen Goals by drawing a line from the word to all the relevant Goals.<br><br>
                    Students can then complete the rest of the worksheet by choosing which other skills listed in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 6</span> they think are<br>
                    the most important for achieving the Goals and connecting those skills to the Goals they think will most beneft.<br>
                    Throughout the activity, stop the class to ask students which skills they have identifed as most important. Ask students<br>
                    to share some of their opinions as to why they have selected a skill for a specifc Goal.<br><br>

        <h6 class="list" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1px; margin-top: 20px;">The next step is for students to identify their own personal skills. Invite students to spend<br>
          some time thinking about their answers to the following questions. They may want to confer<br>
          with a partner for further suggestions.<br><br>
          <i><span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">1.</span>What is special about you that makes you unique?<br>

          Encourage students to think about and select as many words as possible. It is important to stress to students that<br>
          they are not choosing words that describe physical appearance, but rather words to describe characteristics, skills<br>
          and knowledge. As a prompt, you could refer to the words listed in Appendix 6.</h6>

                can be most helpful to them as they take action for the SDGs. Use this opportunity to explain that it is about<br>
                accepting everyone is different and that their different interests and ambitions are what is needed to achieve the<br>
                SDGs. You could show some examples of Goalkeeper portraits: <a href="http://perfectdaylondon.com/projects/goalkeepers/">http://perfectdaylondon.com/projects/goalkeepers/</a><br><br>
                Students upload a photo of themselves on the Goalkeeper app website and can personalise their<br>
                portraits according to colour and words. (See <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 7</span> for the full list of instructions).<br>
                Teachers could also demonstrate uploading a photo using multimedia or use own smartphone as an example<br>
                (particularly in low cost schools.)<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternative:</span> If camera phones/cameras are not available provide mirrors and invite students to draw/paint or make<br>
                a collage image of themselves. Students can then use this image and their 3 chosen words to create a Goalkeeper<br>
                portrait (See the Goalkeeper Portrait template in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 8</span>). The Goalkeeper portraits can then be shown as a<br>
                classroom or school display. Challenge students to think where else they could displayed. <i>Where could they display<br>

                      <h3 class="list" style="font-size: 18px;">Team Aqua is a team of three boys—
                        Olude Marvelous, Ernest Ogunyemi, and
                        Amao David—who came up with the idea
                        of indigenizing the bio-sand water to
                        provide portable water to people in their
                        community. The indigenous bio-sand
                        water flter project which they came up
                        with makes use of locally available
                        materials, which means that it is cheap
                        and affordable, and it is currently in use in

                      Mainly, it was the environment. Living in a community where sanitation is probably a fantasy, a country where
                      the number of people with clean and safe drinking water are far fewer than those who use smartphones.
                      Add to that the fact that nobody seems to care, not because they don’t want to, but rather because they
                      lack the wherewithal to. As a result, all we could think of was how we could, by our little contribution,
                      cause a little change: a change that means families have portable water, and lives are saved.<br><br>
                      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. What motivates you to keep going?</span><br>
                      Our motivation, frst, was the Beyond School Community Challenge, an initiative of the Mandela Washington
                      Fellows Alumni in Nigeria, where the judges and many more people supported our project by: awarding us a cash
                      prize, sharing experiences and telling us how we could improve. That was the start-up motivation, but daily our
                      motivation is the impact, though little, the project has had and continues to have on our community, and how many
                      young people are one step ahead to make moves too. Our frst project, which was a bio-gas plant for the school
                      laboratory, has always motivated us to keep working on the indigenous bio-sand water flter project.<br><br>
                      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Why do you think young people are important in helping to achieve the SDGs?</span><br>
                      Our answer is “why-not”. Having met a whole lot of young people from all over Nigeria and many others from
                      around the world who are helping to make the world a better place, one would only wonder what they can do in
                      helping us all achieve the Goals. Young people possess a kind of magical spirit that gives them the will to pursue
                      and achieve whatever it is they set their mind to achieve, despite the odds and hurdles that lace their path. Add to
                      that the fact that the young people in the world today, almost two billion, are an enormous force. That there are so
                      many of us here means: we play a major role in whatever happens in our world. Also, young people are very
                      important because most of the SDGs are their goals. It is the young people who need
                      Quality Education more, it is the young people who will be here to witness whatever does/doesn’t
                      (depending on how we deal with it) befall the earth.<br><br>
                      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. What does being a Goalkeeper mean to you?</span><br>
                      To be a Goalkeeper to us is to live each day in a way that affects our community for good; it is the small joy that we
                      feel knowing that somebody somewhere is safe; that girls and boys are not lost to the variety of water diseases that
                      have killed most of our dreams in sub-Saharan Africa and in other parts of the world.</h6>

                                        As a team we found out that teenage girls around the world especially in Nigeria are facing a lot of challenges of which
sexual assault and harassment is a major one. We found out that this problem skyrockets on a daily basis according to
statistics. Also, personal experiences as well as peoples life stories have inspired us to take action for Goal 5 - Gender

                                        Technology has been a major influence on the execution of our Goal, it has kept us going from the onset. Also the
passion we have for this Goal is what keeps us going. Using the internet has allowed us to impact people on a global
scale. An example of this is a website which we have created and has served as a major tool in achieving this Goal.
The positive response from lives we save also keeps us going.<br><br>

                                        We are in the 21st century and the world is filled with young people. This sends a signal that the more young are
involved in passion projects like this the more our society develops. In fact engaging in achieving goals like this should

                                        Being a goal keeper makes us aware of our society. To help our community where help is needed and to find like
minded people to collaborate with in order to achieve the Goals effectively. This is a reflection of our partnership model

                  Well, growing up in one of the poorest countries is not an easy thing, especially for girls. We grow up having few or
no choices, and less opportunities in life. It’s so sad that people grow up without knowing that they have basic human
rights which needs to be safeguarded and defended. The most painful thing was to see my fellow young girls not
speaking out for themselves whenever their rights are violated, or are facing any challenge in their lives. Education
is one of the fundamental human rights, but most girls do not have it. When I saw child marriage happening within
my family, friends, and within my community; I decided to step up for them. Child marriage is one of the devastating
traditions that has affected so many girls who would have been productive citizens. I thought it’s high time girls
are given equal opportunities to stay in school and participate in both social, political and economic activities.<br><br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. What motivates you to keep going?</span><br>
                  What motivates me to keep going is the progress that we are making. Girls are rising above their challenges and are
challenging the status-quo. Girls are standing up for themselves and making a difference in their communities, they
are becoming leaders, change makers; they are standing up for their rights. This shows that Gender Equality (Goal
5) is an achievable Goal.<br><br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Why do you think young people are important in helping to achieve the SDGs?</span><br>
                  Young people are mostly affected by the limitations of each Goal, it is therefore important that young people
are involved in every activity that affect their lives everywhere in the world. Without young people the Goals
will not be achieved. The overall umbrella objective of the SDGs is to leave no one behind. Young people
have to be a part of everything so that we make a sustainable foundation for the next generation.<br><br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. What does being a Goalkeeper mean to you?</span><br>
                  Being a Goalkeeper is being able to spot a social problem and know what to do and respond to it by taking
the lead, and starting to think differently and believing yourself that change will happen. And there are
no superpowers for one to be a Goalkeeper, everyone can be a Goalkeeper by simply choosing any of
the SDGs and start pushing for progress. Change happens when there is passion, will, and action.</h6>

                  We both had the luxury of growing up in a culturally and ethnically diverse city, London. When we went
                  to University in Manchester, we quickly learnt that despite this upbringing, we still had a fairly narrowminded experience of the world and more importantly, the various cultures and identities which make it up.
                  We felt that there was a chance to create a platform which explored the stories of different people from
                  around Campus, and when we graduated we wanted to scale this to beyond University and Manchester.
                  Having both frst hand witnessed both overt and covert discrimination, we know the negative effects of not
                  understanding different cultures and now more so than ever, we want to help curb these attitudes.<br><br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. What motivates you to keep going?</span><br>
                  Using video has allowed us to impact people on a global scale, creating content which has been viewed and
shared on all four corners of the globe. An example of this is with a viral video we created called What I Wasn’t
Taught In School. The video sees a college student challenge his teacher about the teaching of black history in
schools. This video has amassed over 40 million views across various social platforms and we continue to receive
emails from Lesotho to Louisiana telling us about the positive impact the video has had on individuals, schools,
family members and communities. We both had individual family members from Nigeria and Ghana sending us the
videos on Whatsapp without realising we had produced it! It’s responses like this that motivate us to keep going.<br><br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Why do you think young people are important in helping to achieve the SDGs?</span><br>
                  There are more young people in the world than ever before (approximately 2 billion people between 10 and 24).
This means engaging with them shouldn’t just be seen as important, it should be a prerequisite to the journey of
achieving the Goals. Young people are often the trend setters, we had Whatsapp and Facebook before our parents
did, and we teach them how to use it. Therefore the impact of engaging young people with the Goals is far reaching.<br><br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. What does being a Goalkeeper mean to you?</span><br>
                  Being a Goalkeeper is a daily reminder of the obligation we have to help the community
be a better environment for us all to live and exist with each other. The community of likeminded other Goalkeepers allows us to work collaboratively and not be overwhelmed by
the ambitious aims set by the SDGs. They are achievable and will be achieved.</h6>

                      </div>
                      <h6 class="list" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1px; margin-top: 20px;">1. Take a selfe or ask a friend to take a photo of you. Make sure you can clearly see
                        your face and that you are smiling! It needs to be a close-up photo of your face, you
                        don’t need your body to be in the picture. Save this to your desktop.<br><br>
                        2. Go on to the Goalkeeper app: <a href="http://wllgoalkeeperme.globalgoals.org/">http://wllgoalkeeperme.globalgoals.org/</a><br><br>
                        3. Click on the Camera icon to upload your photo.</h6>

                        <h6 class="list" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1px;">4. Use the icons on the top right corner of each image box to personalise
                        your portraits. The A icon is where you select your words, the
                        paintbrush changes the colour of the text and the half-flled in circle is
                        where you can choose the coloured-tint to your photographs.<br><br>
                        5. Before saving your Goalkeeper portrait, ensure you have read
                        the <a href="http://cdn.worldslargestlesson.globalgoals.org/2018/06/goalkeeper-privacy1-1.pdf">Terms and Conditions</a> of the Goalkeeper app.<br><br>
                        6. There are two options for saving your portrait: By clicking on the blue
                        Save button it will automatically download to your computer. Or the Save
                        To Gallery button will save and download your Goalkeeper portrait to
                        your computer as well as sharing it on the public gallery platform.<br><br>
